>An array data structure, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements(values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key.

## Search target in array
1. When the array is not sorted, we can only use linear search(brutal force) to iterate the whole array to find the target:

```
int target = 5;
int[] array = new int[] {4,1,5,8,9,0,2}

public bool Exist(int[] arr, int target)
{
    foreach(var num in arr)
    {
        if(num == target) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

2. When the array is sorted (in increasing or decreasing order), binary search is preferred:
int target = 5;
int[] array = new int[] {0,1,2,4,5,8,9} // sorted in increasing order

```
public bool Exist(int[] arr, int target)
{
    var left = 0;
    var right = arr.Length -1;
    while(left < right)
    {
        var mid = (left + right) /2;
        if(arr[mid] == target) return true;
        else if(arr[mid] < target) left = mid +1;
        else right = mid -1;
    }
    return false;
}
```

## Common strategies to solve `Array` type of questions

### Two Pointers
Two pointer technique is an easy and effective technique which is typically used for **searching pairs** in a sorted arrays.

Example:

### Frequency List
Build frequency list to find common elements appear in every object (eg: common char in a list of strings) is also a commonly used problem solving technique:

```
// find all common characters in a list of strings
// ["bella", "label", "roller"] => ["e", "l", "l"]
    var frequencyList = new int[26];
    Array.Fill(frequencyList, int.MaxValue);

        foreach (var str in A)
        {
            var countList = BuildStrFrequencyList(str);
            for (int i = 0; i < frequencyList.Length; i++)
            {
                frequencyList[i] = Math.Min(countList[i], frequencyList[i]);
            }
        }

private int[] BuildStrFrequencyList(string str)
        {
            int[] count = new int[26];
            foreach (var chr in str)
            {
                count[chr - 'a']++;
            }
            return count;
        }
```

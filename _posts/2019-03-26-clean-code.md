# Clean Code Concepts & Good Practice for Writing Code
This blog is a summary of some good practice of writing clean code I came across on the Internet. And most of the concepts are from [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) and [Code Complete](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=code+complete&qid=1553570302&s=books&sr=1-1). Please note some of the examples or snippets are not necessarily the "best practices" for a particular solution, they are just some brilliant coding styles that user3301 personally believes it's clean and readable for human. This blog will keep updating.

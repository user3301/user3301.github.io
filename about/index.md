## About User3301
User3301 is a person who loves to bring his culinary knowledge to the programming world - he always writes 'write once, debug everywhere' aka the 'spaghetti code' and vice versa. He also cooks himself `Fibonacci Meals`, and the recipe is:
<script type="text/javascript" async src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"> </script>
Fib(today's\ meal) = Fib(yesterday's\ meal) + Fib(The\ day\ before\ yesterday's\ meal)


 So if one looks at things positively, it is very beneficial to work alongside with user3301 as debugging and refactoring his code is a good exercise to make them aware of common traps they can fall into while coding. Hence user3301 is a gem of the agile development team if you see things from other angle.

## Skills
* Programming Languages Proficiency 
1. `C#` - Because it's his current boss's language of choice;
2. `Python` - Not only making his life a lot easier by affording him to sketch out a prototype quickly to prove some of his initial idea but also allows him to visualize some heavy lifting stuff in `Jupyter Notebook` to non-programmers.
3. `Java` - Used to be a `Java` fanboy because it is his first programming language he learnt from university and worked as a Java developer for a while. Now he still uses `Java` on and off for some out sourcing tasks and solving some algorithm riddles on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/user3301/).
4. `Javascript & Typescript` - Needs to have the literacy of these two languages in order to have an intelligent conversation with front-end guys.
5. `C++` - Not a pro.

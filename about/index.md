## About User3301
User3301 is a person who loves to bring his culinary knowledge to the programming world - he always writes 'write once, debug everywhere' aka the 'speghetti code'. So if one looks at things positively, it is very beneficial to work alongside with user3301 as debugging and refactoring his code is a good exercise to make them aware of common traps they can fall into while coding. Hence user3301 is a gem of the agile development team if you see things from other angle.

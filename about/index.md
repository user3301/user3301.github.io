## Skills
* Programming Languages Proficiency 
1. `C#` - Because it's his current boss's language of choice;
2. `Python` - Not only making his life a lot easier by affording him to sketch out a prototype quickly to prove some of his initial idea but also allows him to visualize some heavy lifting stuff in `Jupyter Notebook` to non-programmers.
3. `Java` - Used to be a `Java` fanboy because it is his first programming language he learnt from university and worked as a Java developer for a while. Now he still uses `Java` on and off for some out sourcing tasks and solving some algorithm riddles on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/user3301/).
4. `Javascript & Typescript` - Needs to have the literacy of these two languages in order to have an intelligent conversation with front-end guys.
5. `C++` - Not a pro.

## About user3301
I am a programmer who is passionate about coding and Chinese underground HIP-HOP music. This is my one and only blog, I do realise I am very late to this game. Now I have time to write some stuff. Follow this blog if you like Java, Kotlin, and Chinese rappers like 海尔兄弟(Higher brothers), 艾福杰尼（Afterjourney） etc.

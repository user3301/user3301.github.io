## About User3301
User3301 is a person who loves to bring his culinary knowledge to the programming world - he always writes 'write once, debug everywhere' aka the 'speghetti code'. So if one looks at things positively, it is very beneficial to work alongside with user3301 as debugging and refactoring his code is a good exercise to make them aware of common traps they can fall into while coding. Hence user3301 is a gem of the agile development team if you see things from other angle.

User3301 is also a long time lurker in [Imgur.com](https://imgur.com/). Unlike most imgurians, user3301 is never being toxic towards redditors.

## Skills
* Programming Languages Proficiency 
> User3301 has been used several programming languages in both personal & business environments. Just like most imgurians, his opinion changes around 20 times day, even about politics, let alone choosing the right programming language. Most recently, user3301 uses **Python** and **C#(.Net Core)** quite often as C# is his boss's choice and python is used to make his life a bit easier when it can quickly build up a prototype to prove if his idea is a dead end or not beforehand.
* Algorithms & Data Structure
